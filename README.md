# A Basic Reqnroll Test Project using xUnit Example

The .NET Solution contains three projects:

* Simple.MVC.Login: which is a simple Login screen to be used by Reqnroll and Selenium later as an example of a BDD scenario test;
* ReqnrollSeleniumTestProject.xUnit: the BDD scenario test example using the previous described MVC Login application;
* ReqnrollTestProject.xUnit: an isolate BDD scenario example that was the first implementation to understand concepts and then come up with the Login screen scenario to consider a BDD scenario from a working screen.
